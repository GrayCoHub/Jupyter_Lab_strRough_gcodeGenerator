# Jupyter_Lab_strRough_gcodeGenerator
Gcode generator.  Uses 3 separate notebook files sequentially to output the code.  Lots of extraneous devcode that needs deletion from each notebook.

Was created using Jupyter lab with the r kernel.  There is a forced stop in each notebook.  The unused devcode was pasted below the stops.
These files can certainly stand being "cleaned up".
